# Random Number Guesser Game

This is a simple console-based guessing game where the user tries to guess a random integer between 1 and 10. The game is written in Python and uses the `random` and `tkinter` modules.

## How to Play

1. Install Python on your computer if you haven't already. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

3. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

4. Run the following command to start the game:

   ```
   python random_number_guesser.py
   ```

5. A graphical user interface (GUI) window will appear. The window prompts the user to input a number between 1 and 10 in an entry widget. After the user enters their guess, they can click a "Check" button or press the "Enter" key to check if their guess is correct. Depending on the user's guess, the game will display a feedback label letting them know if they guessed too low, too high, or correctly.

6. Keep guessing until you guess the correct number!
